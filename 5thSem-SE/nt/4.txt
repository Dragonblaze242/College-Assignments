COnstructive COst estimation MOdel (COCOMO) was proposed by Boehm
[1981]. COCOMO prescribes a three stage process for project
estimation. In the first stage, an initial estimate is arrived at. Over the
next two stages, the initial estimate is refined to arrive at a more
accurate estimate. COCOMO uses both single and multivariable
estimation models at different stages of estimation.
The three stages of COCOMO estimation technique areâ€”basic COCOMO,
intermediate COCOMO, and complete COCOMO.


Divides software product developments into 3 categories: 
Organic 
Semidetached 
Embedded

Organic: 
Relatively small groups: the size of the development team is reasonably small, and the team members are experienced in developing similar types of projects. 
working to develop well-understood applications.
Semidetached:
Project team consists of a mixture of experienced and  inexperienced staff. 
Embedded: 
The software is strongly coupled to complex hardware,  or real-time systems.

What is a person-month?
Person-month (PM) is a popular unit for effort measurement.
Person-month (PM) is considered to be an appropriate unit for measuring effort,
because developers are typically assigned to a project for a certain number of
months.
